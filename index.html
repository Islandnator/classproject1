	<h1>27 SEP 2020 Darius Eiland Interests and Hobbies</h1>
	<p>Hi class, my name is Darius Eiland. I am currently serving in the U.S. Air Force doing human resource work. I enjoy relaxing and
	occasionally playing video games. My hobbies include collecting sneakers, financial investing, and watching youtube. Although, I 
	have been in the military for the past seven years, I don't plan on retiring. I am single with no kids and and I don't expect that
	to change anytime soon. I would like to do more traveling at some point as I also enjoy  driving on the open road. Being able to
	afford nicer vehicles some day is definitely a goal of mine.</p>

	<p>With a degree in programming, and IT certifications, I aspire to work in the IT career field as a Full Stack Web Developer or 
	perhaps a DevOps (Developer Operations) Engineer. Network Admistrator and IT Support Specialists are also good careers I am exploring. The 
	great aspect of these careers in my opinion is work autonomy giving you the freedom to work remotely and set your own hours. You 
	can also freelance as a programmer/developer. The oppotunities for career advancement and increasing pay presents the ideal job 
	for me to pursue.</p>

	<p><strong>*Currently, I'm into passive investing. I own two brokerage accounts as well as a TSP (Thrift Savings Plan). TSP is the military's
 	 version of the 401k. Above is a screenshot of the S and P 500 index. It is one of the index funds I invest in.</strong></p>
