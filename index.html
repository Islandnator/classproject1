		<h1>27 SEP 2020 Darius Eiland Personal Interests</h1>
	
		<h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my page. My name is Darius Eiland. I am currently serving in the U.S. Air Force doing human resource work. I enjoy relaxing and occasionally playing video games. My hobbies include collecting sneakers, financial investing, and watching Youtube. Although, I have been in the military for the past seven years, I don't plan on retiring. I am single with no kids and I don't expect that to change anytime soon. I would like to do more traveling at some point as I also enjoy driving on the open road. Being able to
		afford nicer vehicles some day is definitely a goal of mine.</p>

		<h2>Future Plans and Goals</h2>
		<p>With a degree in programming, and IT certifications, I aspire to work in the IT career field as a Full Stack Web Developer or 
		perhaps a DevOps (Developer Operations). Network Administrator and IT Support Specialists are also good careers I am exploring. The 
		great aspect of these careers in my opinion is work autonomy giving you the freedom to work remotely and set your own hours. You 
		can also freelance as a programmer/developer. The opportunities for career advancement and increasing pay presents the ideal job 
		for me to pursue.</p>
