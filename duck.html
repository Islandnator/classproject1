 	<h2>Sneaker Collection</h2>
 	<p>My love for sneakers began at a young age. Due to my family's poor economic standing, my parents was not able to afford the more prestigious brands. I felt a little ostracized as most of my classmates owned the latest and greatest sneakers. In 4th grade, I can remember receiving my first pair of Nike's from my mother on Christmas.  The overwhelming joy I felt is a moment I will not forget. My friends were extremely surprised to watch me struct around in my new shoes from the world's top brand.  Moving forward, I was able to continue to secure shoes that were of name brand quality on an occasional basis but they were not exactly the shoes I dreamed of having. Air Jordans were considered the cream of the crop and the price of them continued to remain out of reach.  When I became of age, I was finally able to afford the sneakers I always wanted. Price was no longer a deterrent. Over the past 10 years, I purchased a variety of sneakers from Air Jordan and Nike culminating in a total value of over 13,000 dollars.</p>

 	<h2>Investing</h2>
 	<p>I was introduced to the world of financial investing after opting into the military's version of the 401k plan called TSP (Thrift Savings Plan). I did plenty of research getting as much information as I possibly could on investing in index funds. Eventually I would stumble upon financial guru Dave Ramsey. His Youtube videos and his website <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com">daveramsey.com</a> provided good information on not only how to invest but to build financial wealth over time. I was fascinated about the possibility of building wealth by allowing your money to work for you. I currently invest in TSP as well as two additional index funds the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. Both have performed extraordinarily well over the past 10 years yielding great returns.</p>
