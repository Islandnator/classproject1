		<h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
			<div class="wrapper">
			<p>Welcome to my page. My name is Darius Eiland. I am currently serving in the U.S. Air Force doing human resource work. I enjoy relaxing and occasionally playing video games. My hobbies include collecting sneakers, financial investing, and watching Youtube. Although, I have been in the military for the past seven years, I don't plan on retiring. I am single with no kids and I don't expect that to change anytime soon. I would like to do more traveling at some point as I also enjoy driving on the open road. Being able to
			afford nicer vehicles some day is definitely a goal of mine.</p>

		<h2>Future Plans and Goals</h2>
			<div class="wrapper">
			<p>With a degree in programming, and IT certifications, I aspire to work in the IT career field as a Full Stack Web Developer or 
			perhaps a DevOps (Developer Operations). Network Administrator and IT Support Specialists are also good careers I am exploring. The 
			great aspect of these careers in my opinion is work autonomy giving you the freedom to work remotely and set your own hours. You 
			can also freelance as a programmer/developer. The opportunities for career advancement and increasing pay presents the ideal job 
			for me to pursue.</p>

 		<h3>Sneaker Collection</h3>
 			<div class="wrapper">
 			<p>My love for sneakers began at a young age. Due to my family's poor economic standing, my parents was not able to afford the more presitigous brands. I felt a little ostracized as most of my classmates owned the latest and greatest sneakers. In 4th grade, I can remember receiving my first pair of Nike's from my mother on Christmas.  The overwhelming joy I felt is a moment I will not forget. My friends were extremely surprised to watch me struct around in my new shoes from the world's top brand.  Moving forward, I was able to continue to secure shoes that were of name brand quality on an occasional basis but they were not exactly the shoes I dreamed of having. Air Jordans were considered the cream of the crop and the price of them continued to remain out of reach.  When I became of age, I was finally able to afford the sneakers I always wanted. Price was no longer a deterrent. Over the past 10 years, I purchased a variety of sneakers from Air Jordan and Nike culminating in a total value of over 13,000 dollars.</p>

Both are currently valued between 400 and 500 USD.</strong></p>

 		<h3>Investing</h3>
 			<div class="wrapper">
 			<p>I was introduced to the world of financial investing after opting into the military's version of the 401k plan called TSP (Thrift Savings Plan). I did plenty of research getting as much information as I possibly could on investing in index funds. Eventually I would stumble upon financial guru Dave Ramsey. His Youtube videos and his website <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com">daveramsey.com</a> provided good information on not only how to invest but to build financial wealth over time. I was fascinated about the possibility of building wealth by allowing your money to work for you. I currently invest in TSP as well as two additional index funds the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. Both have performed extraordinarily well over the past 10 years yielding great returns.</p>

 			<h3>Drag Times</h3>
 				<p>I don't believe I will ever be able to own any of these exotic cars shown below but a C8 Corvette or a Toyota Supra may be possible. Drag Times is one of my favorite Youtube channels I enjoy watching. I have an interest in owning a nice car or two with plenty of horsepower in the future.</p>
